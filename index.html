              There are certain instances when we feel pressured to make
              progress, especially when we see others achieving their goals, we
              may be urged to work double-time and non-stop so that we won't be
              left behind. The idle time that we use for breaks may feel like a
              sin because we are trying too hard to catch up or go beyond what
              we have achieved so far.<br /><br />Although you may think that
              this action is a positive one, it can only do you more harm than
              good.<br /><br />Working non-stop will only drain the life out of
              you.<br /><br />Take these as examples:<br /><br />If youâ€™re an
              athlete/body builder/dancer/etc., the first thing that you need to
              take care of is your well-being. If you are overworked in your
              training, you are prone to get fatigue and injuries.<br /><br />For
              the programmer, if you code or create non-stop, youâ€™ll drain your
              creative juices and face a creative block.<br /><br />For the
              businesspersons, if you work continuously, and sacrificing your
              sleep, youâ€™ll be prone to getting sick.<br /><br />Going at your
              own pace is important when you want to achieve something. Break
              down your goals into bite size pieces to pace yourself. Donâ€™t
              squeeze everything in a short amount of time.<br /><br />Donâ€™t
              forget to celebrate your small achievements, it will keep you
              motivated.<br /><br />It is your mind and body that we are talking
              about, so you must know the boundaries of your limits. Donâ€™t go
              comparing your achievements with others as we all have our own
              circumstances.<br /><br />Donâ€™t feel guilty if you take breaks.<br /><br />Go
              on a short walk. Find a new hobby and learn new things. Catch up
              with your friends and family. Have a hobby or fun outside school
              and connect with others. Understand that we are only humans, and
              there are essential routines that we need to do to take care of
              our well-being. <br /><br />Even robots need to recharge to
              function well ðŸ˜‰<br /><br />So, what more with us humans right?<br /><br />
